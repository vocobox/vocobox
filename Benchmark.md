# Benchmarks

<a href="https://github.com/vocobox/vocobox/tree/master/dev/java/vocobox-apps">Vocobox applications</a> allow to evaluate pitch detection in various ways : bulk evaluation on note datasets, live evaluation with microphone, etc.

## Benchmarks on note dataset

Dataset based benchmarks evaluate voice on a folder of notes and report charts indicating latency and accuracy of the estimation.

The following chart mozaic shows :
* pitch detection results of Yin algorithm on a range of notes sung by a human from D1 to A#3 (hence the empty row in the note matrix : D1 makes the note serie start at row 1 for octave 1).
* the estimation accuracy and latency as a green cross : horizontal line shows the maximum accepted semitone error (here 0.5), the vertical line shows the first time pitch detection got a frequency within the bounds of the maximum accepted semitone error. The red dots indicate the semitone error in time.

<font color="orange">There is approximately 0.1s latency for each note pitch detection. We do not pretend this is the best possible performance with TarsosDSP's Yin, but rather how we were able to use it so far. See also next section on voyel benchmarks.</font>

Using <a href="https://github.com/jzy3d/jzy3d-spectro">Jzy3d Spectro</a> we can also draw each wav file FFT easily as well :

## Benchmarks on voyel dataset

Below is a comparative evaluation we did on voyels. It shows precision is not related to a voyel category.

## Benchmarks on live voice

<a href="https://github.com/vocobox/vocobox">Vocobox</a> allows to evaluate pitch detection algorithms with a microphone, and thus have a sense of pitch detection efficiency.

Note that Vocobox can also work with other inputs than voice :
* wav file (perform pitch detection on input sound)
* csv file (synthetizer commands can be generated by other programs)
